restructured and optimized code
rearranged UI elements
new quit hotkey that allows for quickly exiting both the game and the script
slightly increased the default keystroke delay from 50ms to 75ms (game session restart)
adjusted delays for Auto Slide Macro
the key for grenades can now be configured in case you changed the ingame binding
all key/button dialogue fields now use an Edit element instead of Hotkey, this allows for more flexibility from within the UI (e.g. directly setting up mouse buttons and Shift/Control keys) but requires some knowledge of the key codes
two new buttons:
- open a list of key codes
- open the tool's download page so you can check for updates


v3:

complete rework of the code
GUI expanded with new options:
- Auto-Start: When activating the checkbox Borderlands 3 is automatically started upon starting BL3 Utilities. Therefore the batch file is now redundant.
- Custom Applications: You can run any program or file directly from within the GUI.


v2:

included a batch file that automatically and simultaneously starts the script and BL3
you need to open it in a text editor and change the variables for the folders your game and the script are located in
